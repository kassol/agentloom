# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
├── internal/
├── cmd/
└── web/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, either reconsider whether you're inventing language the project doesn't use or note a real gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
